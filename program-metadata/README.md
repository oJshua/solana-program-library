# SPL Program Metadata

## Summary

This program allows for metadata to be associated with programs that can help to ensure the authenticity of the program, provide an IDL (Interface Description Language) specification describing how the program is used, provide the method of data serialization employed by a program, and other important details related to a program (e.g. GitHub repository, website, assets etc.).
